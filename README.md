# vim-x12

A very simple [X12 EDI][x12-edi] syntax highlighting plugin for Vim.

Reading X12 EDI documents give you headaches? Adding syntax highlighting makes a pretty big difference when you are trying to parse the contents of a one-thousand-line EDI 210.

This syntax plugin is incredibly simple, and built around the documents that I read on a regular basis in the transportation industry.
It isn't perfect, but I have found that it helps make larger documents easier to read.
